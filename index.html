==================================================
SLIDE 30
==================================================

Scroll Geometry and Transport Mechanics
Importance of Conveying Speed
Directly dictates residence time of solids within centrifuge
Critically affects:
Dewatering efficiency: Longer residence times allow more complete liquid drainage

==================================================
SLIDE 31
==================================================

Scroll Geometry Effects (cont.)

==================================================
SLIDE 32
==================================================

Role of Scroll Geometry
Physical configuration fundamentally determines solids transport rate
Manufacturers tailor geometries to specific applications
Key parameters interact with differential speed to establish conveying dynamics
Critical for optimizing performance and product quality


==================================================
SLIDE 33
==================================================

Key Geometric Parameters

Outer diameter of the scroll flights
Varies axially in conical centrifuges
Defines conveying channel boundary


==================================================
SLIDE 34
==================================================

Key Geometric Parameters (cont.)
2. Scroll Pitch (P)
Axial distance per 360° turn of the helix
Directly influences conveying speed
Standard pitch (P=D), Short (P=2/3D, P=1/2D), Long (P=1.5D)


==================================================

==================================================
SLIDE 38
==================================================

Scroll Geometry (continued)
The transport process is aided by the inclination of the conical basket wall
Solids often accumulate in piles of triangular cross-section ahead of scroll flights
Scroll performs dual regulatory function:
In wet zones: Holds back material that would slide too quickly
In dry zones: Actively pushes material toward discharge
Adapts to changing frictional properties as material dewaters


==================================================
SLIDE 39
==================================================

Axial Velocity and Efficiency Calculations
Axial Conveying Velocity
Theoretical volumetric throughput: Q_th = (π/4)(D_s^2-d_c^2)P×Δ N×η_vol
Axial velocity: v_ax = Q_th/A_eff = [(π/4)(D_s^2-d_c^2)P×Δ N×η_vol]/[(π/4)(D_s^2-d_c^2)η_fill]
Simplified as: v_ax = P × ΔN × η_slip


==================================================
SLIDE 40
==================================================

Vortex Efficiency (Theoretical Conveying Efficiency)
Based on helix angle and friction: η_vortex = [tan(α_m+ρ')]/[tan(α_m)]
α_m = helix angle at effective radius
ρ' = effective friction angle
Shorter pitches reduce theoretical capacity but increase efficiency against resistance


==================================================
SLIDE 41
==================================================

Differential Speed and Conveying Rate

For fixed eccentric shaft: Δn = n_TR/i
For dual drive systems: Δn = n_TR - (n_EXZ × i)
n_TR = drum speed
n_EXZ = eccentric shaft speed
i = gear ratio (typically 1:15 to 1:40)


==================================================
SLIDE 42
==================================================

Scroll Speed Calculation
Scroll rotational speed: n_Schn = n_TR + (n_EXZ - n_TR)/i
Leading operation: Positive differential (scroll faster than drum)
Trailing operation: Negative differential (scroll slower than drum)


==================================================
SLIDE 43
==================================================

Drainage and Saturation Fundamentals

ρ_L = liquid density (kg/m³)


==================================================
SLIDE 44
==================================================

During film drainage: S = [k'/d][(r_2-r_c)/t]^A + S_∞
r_2-r_c = cake thickness (m)
A = coefficient (0.5-1.0 for incompressible materials)
t = drainage time (s)


==================================================
SLIDE 45
==================================================

Time-dependent saturation: S_t = S_∞ + (1-S_∞)e^(-φt)
Drainage rate constant: φ = [d cos^2 θ]/[2ω^2ρr_o]


==================================================
SLIDE 46
==================================================

Dimensionless Time Analysis
t_D = [μ_L/ρ_L][h G t/h^2]
μ_L = liquid viscosity
ρ_L = liquid density
h = cake height
G = centrifugal acceleration
t = time


==================================================
SLIDE 47
==================================================

Cone Angle Effects on Transport
Component of Centrifugal Force Along Screen
Parallel force component: F_{c,parallel} = F_c sin(θ_c) = mω^2r×sin(θ_c)
This assists in axial transport toward larger diameter end


==================================================
SLIDE 48
==================================================

Transport Force Balance
For particles on inclined screen:
Driving forces: Scroll push + Component of centrifugal force
Resisting forces: Friction against screen × Normal force

==================================================
SLIDE 49
==================================================

Calculating Transport in Practice
Empirical Approach
1. Start with theoretical relationship: v_ax = P × ΔN
2. Adjust for non-standard geometry using capacity factors (CF)
Short pitch (P=2/3D): CF = 1.50
Half pitch (P=1/2D): CF = 2.00
3. Apply efficiency factor based on material properties
Estimated range: 0.3-0.8 depending on material
4. Calculate residence time: t = (60 × w)/Δn
5. Adjust differential speed to achieve desired residence time


==================================================
SLIDE 50
==================================================

Residence Time Control
Residence Time Calculation
t = (60 × w)/Δn
t = residence time (seconds)
w = number of scroll turns/flights
Δn = differential speed (rpm)


==================================================
SLIDE 51
==================================================

Process Implications
Residence time remains constant regardless of feed quantity
Longer residence time improves dewatering but reduces throughput
Shorter residence time increases capacity but may reduce separation efficiency


==================================================
SLIDE 52
==================================================

Scroll Efficiency Factors
Factors Affecting Conveying Efficiency
Friction between material and screen/scroll surfaces
Cone angle contribution to axial movement
G-force magnitude
Material properties (especially moisture content)


==================================================
SLIDE 53
==================================================

Modified Capacity Factors
Standard pitch scroll: CF = 1.00
Short pitch (P=2/3D): CF = 1.50
Half pitch (P=1/2D): CF = 2.00
Flight modifications (cut, folded): CF = 1.50-3.75

==================================================

Scale-Up Methodologies for Centrifuges
Comparative Scale-Up Approaches
1. Sigma Theory (Equivalent Settling Area)
Primary method for sedimentation centrifuges
Based on: Σ = (ω^2/2g) × ∫r×dA
Proportional relationship: Q_1/Σ_1 = Q_2/Σ_2


==================================================
SLIDE 55
==================================================

Sigma Theory Applications
Works well for dilute suspensions with minimal particle interaction
Limitation: Does not account for residence time effects
For tubular bowl: Σ = 2πω^2L/3g
For disk stack: Σ = 2πω^2n_d/3g·tan α
For decanter: Σ = [2πω^2L/g][2r_1r_2/3]


==================================================
SLIDE 56
==================================================

Capacity Factor Approach (C-Value Method)
Comprehensive approach that extends beyond Sigma theory
Incorporates residence time and g-force: f = z × Δt × m
Universal dimensionless number for comparing machines
Applicable across different centrifuge types
Better accounts for solids behavior in concentrated suspensions


==================================================
SLIDE 57
==================================================

Capacity Factor Approach (cont.)
Particularly valuable for screen-scroll and dewatering applications
Scale-up formula: m_2 = m_1 × [z_1 × Δt_1]/[z_2 × Δt_2]


==================================================
SLIDE 58
==================================================

Combined Methodologies for Robust Scale-Up
Use Sigma theory for initial sizing of sedimentation centrifuges
Apply Capacity Factor for final validation and residence time effects
Both approaches complement each other for comprehensive analysis
Critical to maintain dimensionless ratios across scales
For optimum design: Capacity Factor analysis + Drainage model with S_∞ calculations


==================================================
SLIDE 59
==================================================

Engineering Design Analysis and Calculations
Centrifugal Force and Separation Principles
The centrifugal force is the fundamental principle behind the operation of the CONTURBEX H1000
centrifuges at Arab Potash Company. The key equations governing this process are:


==================================================
SLIDE 94
==================================================

Angular Velocity Calculation
1. Angular Velocity Calculation: omega = 2π × N/60
For the APC centrifuges at 797 rpm: omega = 2π × 797/60 = 83.46 rad/s


==================================================
SLIDE 95
==================================================

Relative Centrifugal Force
2. Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF): RCF = r×omega^2/g = r×(2π×N/60)^2/g
With the simplified formula: RCF = 1.118 × 10^-5 × r × N^2
For the H1000 centrifuge with drum radius r = 0.509 m at operating speed: RCF = 1.118 × 10^-5 × 509 ×
797^2 = 353g


==================================================
SLIDE 96
==================================================

Centrifugation Number
3. Centrifugation Number (z): z = (π^2 × D × n^2)/(900 × g)
For the APC installation with D = 1.018 m and n = 797 rpm: z = (π^2 × 1.018 × 797^2)/(900 × 9.81) =
353
This aligns with the RCF calculation and confirms the designed centrifugal acceleration.


==================================================
SLIDE 97
==================================================

Residence Time and Differential Speed Analysis
The residence time is crucial for achieving optimal moisture content in the final product:
1. Residence Time Equation: t = (60 × w)/Δn
Where w is the number of scroll turns and Δn is the differential speed.


==================================================
SLIDE 98
==================================================

Differential Speed Calculation
2. Differential Speed Calculation:
For fixed gearbox: Δn = n_TR/i
For dual drive: Δn = n_TR - (n_EXZ × i)
For the retarded scroll configuration: Δn = -12.1 rpm (gear ratio i = 59)
t = (60 × w)/12.1 = 4.97 seconds
For the advanced scroll configuration: Δn = +13.5 rpm
t = (60 × w)/13.5 = 4.44 seconds


==================================================
SLIDE 99
==================================================

Gap Dimensioning
3. Gap Dimensioning: The gap between scroll and drum is maintained at 1.5-2.0‰ of nominal drum
diameter.
For the H1000 with drum diameter of 1018 mm: Gap = (1.5 to 2.0) × 1.018 = 1.53 to 2.04 mm
This precise gap enables efficient transport while preventing damage.


==================================================
SLIDE 100
==================================================

Sedimentation and Drainage Analysis
The moisture content of the final product is influenced by the sedimentation and drainage processes:
1. Sedimentation Velocity: V_s = [d^2(ρ_p-ρ_m)ω^2r]/(18η)


==================================================
SLIDE 101
==================================================

Sedimentation Velocity Calculation
For potash crystals with d = 0.5 mm, particle density ρp = 1.98 g/cm³, in brine with density ρm = 1.302
g/cm³ and viscosity η = 5 cP:
V_s = [0.5^2 × 10^-6 × (1980-1302) × 83.46^2 × 0.509]/[18 × 5 × 10^-3]
V_s = 17.3 cm/s
This high sedimentation velocity ensures efficient solid-liquid separation.


==================================================
SLIDE 102
==================================================

Drainage Assessment
2. Drainage Assessment: The final moisture content follows the relationship: S =
dk'[ρ_L(ω^2r/g)μ]t^B(r^2-r_c^2)^A + S_∞
Where S_∞ = kd^(-0.5)(ω^2r/g)^(-0.5)ρ_L^(-0.25)
For the APC installation, this translates to the target 7% maximum brine content (4.7% free water).


==================================================
SLIDE 103
==================================================

Dimensionless Time Analysis
3. Dimensionless Time Analysis: t_D = (μ_L/ρ_L)(hGt/h^2)
This parameter helps optimize the balance between throughput and moisture content.


==================================================
SLIDE 104
==================================================

Design Implementation at Arab Potash Company
The engineering calculations directly informed the centrifuge design and configuration at APC:
1. Selection of Dual Configuration Types:
Retarded scroll for final product stages where moisture content is critical

3. Screen Selection Based on Particle Size Distribution:
0.20 mm apertures with 8.3% open area
Optimized for particle size distributions with d50 ranging from 0.16-0.8 mm across applications


==================================================
SLIDE 106
==================================================

Capacity Factor Implementation
4. Capacity Factor Implementation: The benchmark capacity factor of 75,728 translated to operational
capacities of:
51.8 t/h for retarded scroll configuration
48.3 t/h for advanced scroll configuration
With safety factors applied, actual operating capacities range from 28.3-38.3 t/h.


==================================================
SLIDE 107
==================================================

Design Implementation Summary
These calculations demonstrate how theoretical equations are applied to practical design decisions in the
CONTURBEX H1000 centrifuges at Arab Potash Company, optimizing performance across multiple
process streams with varying characteristics.


==================================================
SLIDE 108
==================================================

Capacity Factor Analysis for Installation Sizing
Building on the fundamental equations, the capacity factor approach provides a standardized method for
comparing and scaling centrifuge performance across different applications and operating conditions:
1. Capacity Factor Formulation: f = z · Δt · m
Where:
z = centrifugal acceleration (g-force)
Δt = residence time (seconds)
m = throughput capacity (tonnes/hour)


==================================================
SLIDE 109
==================================================

Benchmark Determination
2. Benchmark Determination: The reference benchmark for this application showed that 100% capacity
was reached with:
z = 282 g
Δt = 4.63 s
m = 58 t/h KCl
This yields a capacity factor of: f = 282 × 4.63 × 58 = 75,728


==================================================
SLIDE 110
==================================================

Arab Potash Installation Sizing
3. Arab Potash Installation Sizing: Using the established capacity factor, the 100% capacity is calculated
based on the actual operating parameters:
For retarded scroll configuration (Δt = 4.97 s): m = f/(z × Δt) = 75,728/(353 × 4.97) = 43.2 t/h KCl
For advanced scroll configuration (Δt = 4.44 s): m = f/(z × Δt) = 75,728/(353 × 4.44) = 48.3 t/h KCl


==================================================
SLIDE 111
==================================================

Safety Factor Application
Applying a safety factor of 25-30% for operational flexibility:
Carnallite centrifuges: 28.3/46.4 tph (actual/maximum)
1st Stage Product centrifuges: 38.3/46.4 tph
2nd Stage Product centrifuges: 37.4/46.4 tph


==================================================
SLIDE 112
==================================================

Installation Optimization Trade-offs
4. Installation Optimization Trade-offs:
Advanced scroll: Higher throughput (48.3 t/h theoretical) with potentially higher residual
moisture
Retarded scroll: Lower throughput (43.2 t/h theoretical) with improved dewatering efficiency
Different configurations selected based on process stream requirements


==================================================

==================================================
SLIDE 120
==================================================

Excessive Solids in Filtrate (cont.)
Corrective Actions:
Repair or replace screen
Adjust operational parameters
Consider pre-classification if persistent


==================================================
SLIDE 121
==================================================

Process Optimization Strategies
Feed Rate Optimization
Maximum sustainable feed rate determined by:
Motor current remaining below 90% of FLA
Vibration levels below 8 mm/s
Acceptable product moisture content


==================================================
SLIDE 122
==================================================

Differential Speed Optimization
Increased differential for difficult-to-separate materials
Decreased differential for materials sensitive to breakage
Optimum determined through systematic testing
Typical range: 2-5% of basket speed


==================================================
SLIDE 123
==================================================

Retention Time Calculation
This means the material moves axially at approximately 91.35 mm/s through the centrifuge, which with a
basket length of 645 mm gives a theoretical retention time of about 7.1 seconds. When compared with
the actual measured retention time of 4.44 seconds, this yields an efficiency factor of 0.63, reflecting
material sliding and other real-world factors.


==================================================
SLIDE 124
==================================================

Moisture Content Prediction and Verification
The final moisture content can be predicted using equilibrium saturation equations:
S_∞ = k'd^(-0.4)(ω^2r/g)^(-0.3)ρ_L^(-0.25)
For KCl with mean particle size d = 0.3 mm, operating at 797 rpm (353g): S_∞ = 0.48 × 0.3^(-0.4) ×
353^(-0.3) × 1.258^(-0.25) = 0.068


==================================================
SLIDE 125
==================================================

Moisture Content Results
This predicts a final liquid volume fraction of 6.8%, which closely matches the achieved moisture content
of 7% in the actual operation.
The time-dependent drainage follows: S = [k'/d][(r_2-r_c)/t]^A + S_∞
For a cake thickness of 15 mm and drainage time of 4.97 seconds (for retarded scroll configuration): S =
[0.48/0.3][(15/4.97)]^0.5 + 0.068 = 0.071
This confirms that the designed residence time is adequate to achieve the required final moisture content
of 7%.


==================================================
SLIDE 126
==================================================

Scale-Up Methodology Demonstration
To demonstrate the practical application of scale-up methodologies, consider scaling up from a pilot
centrifuge (D = 0.5 m, n = 1200 rpm, capacity = 15 t/h) to the industrial CONTURBEX H1000.
Using the Capacity Factor Approach: f = z_1 × Δt_1 × m_1 = z_2 × Δt_2 × m_2


==================================================
SLIDE 127
==================================================

Long-term Performance Optimization
Over five years of operation, the Arab Potash Company has implemented continuous improvement
initiatives based on operational data:
1. Differential Speed Optimization: Initial setting of +15 rpm for carnallite centrifuges resulted in
excessive torque. Through iterative testing and applying the capacity factor equation:
f = z × Δt × m
The optimum was found at +13.5 rpm, balancing throughput and mechanical stress.


==================================================
SLIDE 128
==================================================

Residence Time Adjustment
3. Residence Time Adjustment: For 2nd stage product centrifuges, moisture content was initially 8.3%.
By applying drainage theory:
S = S_∞ + (S_0 - S_∞)e^(-φt)
Residence time was increased from 4.2 to 4.97 seconds by changing differential speed from -10.2 to -12.1
rpm, achieving target moisture of 7%.


==================================================
SLIDE 129
==================================================

Dynamic Differential Speed Control
1. Dynamic Differential Speed Control: Implementation of variable frequency drives to adjust differential
speed in real-time based on:
Δn_optimal = Δn_base × (1 + k_1(S_target - S_measured) + k_2(T_feed - T_base))
Where k₁ and k₂ are empirically determined coefficients.

DRYING EQUIPMENT
Introduction to Drying
Definition of Drying
Drying is the thermal process through which liquid is separated from a solid-liquid mixture by
application of heat
Also accomplished by accelerating evaporation through vacuum
Involves transfer of liquid from a surface into an unsaturated vapor phase

==================================================
SLIDE 2
==================================================
Drying vs. Evaporation
Distinguished by relative quantities of liquid removed from solid
Evaporation: Product is concentrated solution, suspension, or wet slurry
Drying: Dry solid is the final product

==================================================
SLIDE 3
==================================================
Evaporation Factors
Rate of evaporation depends upon:
Nature of the liquid to be evaporated
Amount of heat applied
Nature of air saturation
Surface area of the solid or solid mixture

==================================================
SLIDE 4
==================================================
Importance of Drying
Stability
Dried products are more stable than moist ones
Deterioration can be avoided (e.g., effervescent salts, penicillin)
Inhibits microbial growth & chemical decomposition

==================================================
SLIDE 5
==================================================
Preparation of Bulk Drugs
Often used as final stage of processing
Example: Preparation of dried aluminum hydroxide

==================================================
SLIDE 6

==================================================
Sterilization
Important for sterilization of pharmaceutical equipment and glass wares

==================================================
SLIDE 10
==================================================
Fundamentals of Drying
Relative Humidity
Amount of water vapor in air is usually less than required for saturation
Relative Humidity (RH) = (Actual vapor density / Saturation vapor density) × 100
Approximately equal to percent saturation
Dependent on both moisture amount and temperature

==================================================
SLIDE 11
==================================================
Loss on Drying (LOD)
Water content calculated as percentage of weight of wet solid
LOD = (Weight of water in sample / Total weight of wet sample) × 100

==================================================
SLIDE 12
==================================================
Bound and Unbound Moisture
Bound Moisture: Minimum water held by material that exerts equilibrium vapor pressure less than
pure water at same temperature
Unbound Moisture: Water held by material that exerts equilibrium vapor pressure equal to pure
water at same temperature

==================================================
SLIDE 13
==================================================
Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC)
Amount of water in solid that exerts vapor pressure equal to vapor pressure of surrounding
atmosphere
At EMC, materials neither lose nor gain moisture

==================================================
SLIDE 14
==================================================
Importance of EMC
Helps select proper drying conditions
Helps select proper storage conditions

==================================================
SLIDE 15
==================================================
Factors Affecting EMC
Temperature of surrounding air (inversely proportional to EMC)
Relative humidity (directly proportional to EMC)
Nature of solid: o For non-porous, non-hygroscopic materials, EMC is essentially zero o For colloidal
or fibrous materials, EMC is higher

==================================================
SLIDE 16
==================================================
Mechanisms of Drying
Basic Phenomena
Drying process involves two basic phenomena:
Heat transfer
Mass transfer

==================================================
SLIDE 17
==================================================
Heat Transfer
Heat must be transferred to material to supply latent heat for moisture vaporization
Heating source: flame, steam, hot gas, hot air, etc.

==================================================
SLIDE 18
==================================================
Heat Transfer Mechanisms
Heat may be transferred in three ways:
1. Conduction
2. Convection
3. Radiation

==================================================
SLIDE 19

==================================================
SLIDE 22
==================================================
Drying by Mass Transfer
When heat is applied, water is removed as vapor
Involves diffusion of water from interior to evaporating surface
Subsequent evaporation from surface to passing air stream

==================================================
SLIDE 23
==================================================
Mass Transfer Mechanisms
Mass transfer occurs by two primary mechanisms:
1. Internal mechanisms
2. External mechanisms

==================================================
SLIDE 24
==================================================
Internal Mechanisms
1. Diffusion o Transfer of water through material to evaporating surface o Transfer of vapor to passing
air stream
2. Flow from Shrinkage & Pressure Gradients o When water is removed, pores empty o Solid particles
occupy empty space causing shrinkage o Pressure on squeezed surface creates cracks o Enhances
drying rate

==================================================
SLIDE 25
==================================================
Internal Mechanisms (continued)
3. Gravity o Moisture gravitationally pulled downward o Accumulates beneath lower surface o Water
moves through inner capillaries
4. Vaporization-Condensation Sequence o Surface water vaporizes but can't escape rigid surface o
Trapped moisture condenses in less heated areas o Repeated vaporization-condensation until vapor
escapes

==================================================
SLIDE 26
==================================================
Internal Mechanisms (continued)
5. Capillary Flow o Moisture expelled through intermolecular spaces o Driven by surface tension and
capillary action

==================================================
SLIDE 27
==================================================
External Mechanisms
1. Temperature o Drying rate directly proportional to temperature o Higher temperature enables rapid
drying o Excess heat may affect product stability
2. Humidity o Drying rate inversely proportional to surrounding humidity o Saturated areas impede
drying even at high temperatures o Lower humidity enhances drying

==================================================
SLIDE 28
==================================================
External Mechanisms (continued)
3. Agitation o Enhances evaporation by exposing new surface areas o Ensures uniform heat distribution
o Prevents partial burning or wetting
4. Method of Supporting the Solid o Different dryers support materials differently o Metallic tray
preferable for better heat transfer o Relative drying capacity: Dilute bed > Fluidized bed > Moving
bed > Static bed

==================================================
SLIDE 29
==================================================
External Mechanisms (continued)
5. State of Subdivision o Finer particles have larger surface area exposure o Enhances drying rate
6. Nature of the Particle o Porous particles dry easier o Fibrous materials take longer

==================================================
SLIDE 30
==================================================
External Mechanisms (continued)
7. Vacuum o Efficient for thermolabile substances o Allows drying at lower temperatures
8. Other Factors o Contact between hot surface and wet solid o Bulk of material o Drying period o
Heating time

3. Inner Loop - Outlet Temperature: • Use exponential drying relation to predict temperature drop • NT
= ln((T2-Ts)/(T1-Ts)) • For each zone: calculate heat transfer • Apply energy balance: L C s(Tso-Tsi) =
G C g(T2-T1)
4. Validation: • Compare calculated L with guessed L • If different, adjust and repeat from step 2 • If
same, solution found

Critical Performance Variables
Process Variables:
Particle size distribution

Flow rate
Equipment Variables:
Cyclone diameter
Vortex finder diameter
Apex diameter
Feed inlet configuration

==================================================
SLIDE 13
==================================================
Pressure Drop & Capacity Relationship
Pressure drop directly affects separation performance
Higher pressure = finer separation
Typical operating range: 5-40 PSI (0.35-2.75 bar)
Flow capacity increases with: o Cyclone diameter o Pressure drop o Reduced feed concentration

==================================================
SLIDE 14
==================================================
D50 Cut Point Influences
D50: Particle size with 50% chance of reporting to overflow/underflow
Factors Affecting D50:
Cyclone diameter: Larger diameter = higher D50
Pressure drop: Higher pressure = lower D50
Feed concentration: Higher concentration = higher D50
Vortex finder diameter: Larger VF = higher D50
Specific gravity differential: Higher ΔSG = lower D50

==================================================
SLIDE 15
==================================================
Influence of Cyclone Diameter
50% reduction in cyclone diameter = ~43% reduction in D50
Smaller cyclones provide finer separation at the cost of capacity
Appropriate sizing balances separation efficiency with throughput
Operating multiple smaller cyclones often preferred over fewer large units

==================================================
SLIDE 16
==================================================
Effect of Feed Solids Concentration
Higher feed concentration increases hindered settling effects
Optimum feed concentration typically 5-30% by volume
Effect on underflow consistency: o Too low: Dilute underflow o Too high: Roping discharge o Optimal:
40-70% solids in underflow

==================================================
SLIDE 17
==================================================
5. Theoretical Modeling & Equations

==================================================
SLIDE 18
==================================================
Mathematical Models for Cyclone Performance
Three principal approaches:
1. Empirical models: Based on experimental data
2. Semi-empirical models: Combining theory with experimental corrections
3. Computational models: Fluid dynamics simulations
The Plitt model is a widely-accepted semi-empirical approach for predicting cyclone performance.

==================================================
SLIDE 19
==================================================
The Plitt Model
Core equation for d50 calculation:
d50 = Factor * { 50.5 * Dc^0.46 * Di^0.6 * Do^1.21 * exp(0.063 * Cv) } / { Du^0.71 * h^0.38 * Q^0.45 * (ps
- pl)^0.5 }
Where:
d50: Cut size (microns)
Dc: Cyclone diameter (cm)
Di: Feed inlet diameter (cm)
Do: Vortex finder diameter (cm)
Du: Apex diameter (cm)
h: Free vortex height (cm)
Q: Volumetric flow rate (l/min)
Cv: Feed solids volume concentration (%)
ps: Solids density (t/m³)
pl: Liquid density (t/m³)
Factor: Correction factor

==================================================
SLIDE 20
==================================================
Plitt Model - Pressure Drop Calculation
Pressure drop across cyclone (kPa):
ΔP = PressFactor * { 1.88 * Q^1.78 * exp(0.0055 * Cv) } / { Dc^0.37 * Di^0.94 * h^0.28 * (Du² + Do²)^0.87 }
Where:
PressFactor: Pressure correction factor
Other variables as previously defined

==================================================
SLIDE 21
==================================================
Plitt Model - Liquid Split Calculation
Recovery of feed volume to underflow:
Rv = S / (S + 1)
Where S is calculated as:
S = SFactor * { 1.9 * (Du/Do)^3.31 * h^0.54 * (Du² + Do²)^0.36 * exp(0.0054 * Cv) } / { H^0.24 * Dc^1.11 }
Where:
Rv: Recovery of feed volume to underflow
H: Pressure head in meters of feed slurry
SFactor: S correction factor

==================================================
SLIDE 22
==================================================
Plitt Model - Efficiency Curve Calculation
Two methods for calculating partition curves:
1. Lynch Method: y = [exp(a * di/d50) - 1] / [exp(a * di/d50) + exp(a) - 2] Where a = 1.54 * m - 0.47
2. Rosin-Rammler Method: y = 1 - exp(-0.693147 * (di/d50)^m)
Where:
y: Recovery to underflow (corrected basis)
di: Particle size
m: Sharpness of separation

==================================================
SLIDE 23
==================================================
gMAX-Specific Model Adaptations
The Plitt model for gMAX cyclones incorporates:
Modified cone angle factor
Optimized inlet design coefficients
Adjusted vortex finder relationships
Enhanced underflow discharge parameters
These adjustments account for the specific geometry and flow dynamics of the gMAX design.

==================================================
SLIDE 24
==================================================
Corrected Recovery Calculation
Actual recovery to underflow accounts for liquid bypass:
y = y' + Rf * (1 - y')
Where:
y: Actual recovery to underflow
y': Corrected recovery to underflow
Rf: Fraction of feed liquid to underflow
This correction is essential for accurate modeling of fine particle behavior.

==================================================
SLIDE 25
==================================================
Practical Application Example
For a gMAX20 cyclone with:
20" diameter
5" vortex finder
2.5" apex
66% feed solids by weight
2.8 specific gravity solids
500 GPM feed rate
Using the Plitt model equations, we would calculate:
d50 ≈ 250 microns
Pressure drop ≈ 15 PSI
Underflow solids ≈ 75%

==================================================
SLIDE 26
==================================================
Summary & Key Takeaways
Hydrocyclones provide efficient solid-liquid separation
KREBS gMAX design offers improved performance over traditional cyclones
Performance depends on equipment dimensions and process variables
Plitt model provides reliable prediction of cyclone performance
Proper sizing and operation are critical for optimal results
Mathematical modeling enables precise cyclone selection for specific applications

==================================================

Industrial Screening Technology:
Fundamentals and Applications
Introduction to Screening


==================================================
SLIDE 2
==================================================

Basic Terminology
Oversize/Plus Material: Material that remains on a given screening surface
Undersize/Minus Material: Material passing through the screening surface
Intermediate Material: Material passing one screening surface and retained on a subsequent surface
Aperture: Opening in the screening surface (defines separation size)
Open Area (OA): Ratio of total aperture area to total screen deck area
Cut Point: Size at which particles have equal chance of reporting to undersize or oversize
Blinding: Aperture blockage by near-size particles
Pegging: Wedging of particles in apertures


==================================================
SLIDE 3
==================================================

Industrial Screening Applications
Main purposes in the minerals industry:
1. Sizing/Classifying: Separate particles by size for downstream processing
2. Scalping: Remove coarsest fractions for separate processing
3. Grading: Prepare multiple products within specified size ranges
4. Media Recovery: Washing magnetic media from ore in dense medium circuits
5. Dewatering: Drain free moisture from wet sand slurry6. Desliming/De-dusting: Remove fine material below 0.5mm
7. Trash Removal: Remove wood fibers or other contaminants
Key industries: Mining, aggregates, potash, coal, recycling, and chemical processing


==================================================
SLIDE 4
==================================================

Screening Principles: Particle Passage
Screening is a probabilistic process with particles presented to the screen surface multiple times.
Probability of passage for a single spherical particle through a square aperture:
P = ((x-d)/(x+w))^2
Where:
d = particle diameter
x = aperture size
w = wire diameter
For n presentations to the screen: P' = 1-(1-P)^n


==================================================
SLIDE 5
==================================================

Probability of Passage (Table)
 Ratio of particle to aperture size Chance of passage per 1000 Number of apertures required in path
0.001 998 1
0.1 810 2
0.5 250 4
0.7 82 12
0.9 9.8 100
0.95 2.0 500
0.99 0.1 10,000
Near-mesh particles (0.9-1.0 × aperture size) dramatically reduce screening efficiency and can cause
blinding and pegging of apertures.


==================================================
SLIDE 6
==================================================

Stratification and Particle Movement
[Stratification diagram would be here]Stratification process:
1. Mixed feed enters screen deck
2. Vibration causes smaller particles to move down through bed
3. Larger particles rise to the top
4. Near-size particles contact screen surface
5. Undersize particles pass through apertures
6. Oversize continues along deck
Material transport via combination of gravity, inclination, and vibrational forces


==================================================
SLIDE 7
==================================================

Screening Mechanisms
Two main screening zones:
1. Crowded/Saturation Screening:
Initial zone with thick bed (several times aperture thickness)
Rapid stratification of particles
Fines move through interstices of larger particles
Constant flow through apertures
2. Statistical/Separated Screening:
Later zone with reduced bed height
Particles act as individual entities
Each particle has statistical chance to pass through aperture
Efficiency depends on number of presentations


==================================================
SLIDE 8
==================================================

Performance Assessment: Mass Balance
Efficiency calculation from mass balance:
F = feed rate (t/h)
C = coarse/oversize product rate (t/h)
U = fine/undersize product rate (t/h)
f, c, u = fractions of oversize in feed, oversize, and undersize
Basic mass balance equations:F = C + U
Ff = Cc + Uu
F(1-f) = C(1-c) + U(1-u)
Therefore:
C/F = (f-u)/(c-u)
U/F = (c-f)/(c-u)


==================================================
SLIDE 9
==================================================

Performance Assessment: Recovery Calculations
Recovery of oversize to oversize product:
(Cc)/(Ff) = (c(f-u))/(f(c-u))
Recovery of undersize to undersize product:
(U(1-u))/(F(1-f)) = ((1-u)(c-f))/((1-f)(c-u))
Combined efficiency (overall effectiveness):
E = (c(f-u)(1-u)(c-f))/(f(c-u)^2(1-f))
For screens where aperture and cut point are similar and little coarse material in underflow (u ≈ 0):
E = (c-f)/(c(1-f))


==================================================
SLIDE 10
==================================================

Performance Assessment: Partition Curves
[Partition curve would be here]
X-axis: Particle size (log scale)
Y-axis: Percentage reporting to oversize
Ideal curve: Vertical line at aperture size
Real curve: S-shaped with imperfect separation
Cut point (d50): Size at which 50% reports to oversize
Sharpness of separation (α): Typically 0.2-0.7 (higher = sharper)
Bypass (Rf): Fine material incorrectly reporting to oversize
Used for simulation and design purposes in process flowsheets


==================================================
SLIDE 11
==================================================

Factors Affecting Screen Performance1. Particle Size Distribution:
Near-mesh particles (75-125% of aperture size) reduce efficiency
High proportion of half-size material increases capacity
2. Feed Rate:
Higher rates reduce efficiency (thicker bed)
Capacity vs. efficiency trade-off
3. Screen Angle:
Affects particle presentation to apertures
Affects material velocity and residence time
Steeper angles increase capacity but may reduce efficiency
4. Particle Shape:
Irregular, elongated particles have lower passage probability
Slabby particles may "ride" over apertures


==================================================
SLIDE 12
==================================================

More Factors Affecting Performance
5. Open Area:
Higher open area increases capacity
Limited by mechanical strength requirements
6. Vibration:
Affects stratification and particle movement
G-force, frequency, amplitude, and stroke angle all critical
7. Moisture:
Critical range (4-8%) causes maximum difficulty
Below 4%: Dust control needed
Above 8%: Material may flow as slurry
8. Screen Motion:
Type of motion affects transport and stratification
Different motions suited to different applications


==================================================
SLIDE 13
==================================================

Bed Depth Considerations
Theoretical bed depth calculation:
B = (M/ρb)/(3.6Wv)Where:
B = bed depth (mm)
M = solids mass flow (t/h)
ρb = bulk density (t/m³)
W = screen width (m)
v = rock velocity (m/s)
Rule of thumb:
Dry screening: 3:1-4:1 screen apertures in thickness (2:1 common)
Wet screening: 4:1-5:1 times aperture
Larger ratios reduce efficiency of near-size separation
Smaller ratios cause excessive bouncing


==================================================
SLIDE 14
==================================================

Screen Capacity Modeling
Empirical capacity model:
Theoretical area required = (Total t/h undersize in feed)/(C × F1 × F2 × F3 × ... × Fn)
Where:
C = Base-line screen capacity in t/h of undersize per unit area
F₁ to Fₙ are correction factors:
 Factor Description Range
F₁ Oversize quantity 0.7-1.0
F₂ Half-size material 0.8-1.3
F₃ Near-size material 0.5-0.9
F₄ Material density 0.5-1.5
F₅ Deck position 0.8-1.0
F₆ Open area 0.6-1.2
F₇ Aperture shape 0.9-1.15


==================================================
SLIDE 15
==================================================

Vibration Characteristics
G-force calculation: Γ = a(2πf)²/9.81Where:
Γ = vibration g-force
a = amplitude (m)
f = frequency (Hz)
Typical vibrating screen parameters:
G-force: 3-7G (typically 4-5G)
Frequency: 700-1200 rpm for coarse, up to 3600 rpm for fine
Amplitude: 5-15 mm for coarse, smaller for fine screening
Stroke angle: 30-60° to screen deck


==================================================
SLIDE 16
==================================================

G-Force Effects on Screening
 G-Force Range Effects and Applications
<1.5 Practically no movement, ineffective
1.5-2.5 Limited stratification, good for soft materials where degradation is problematic
3.0-3.5 Optimal for inclined screens, good stratification and velocity
4.0-5.0 Good stratification but reduced velocity between deck and particles
5-6 Excessive projection, reduced efficiency, increased wear
Horizontal screens typically require higher G-forces (4.0-4.5) to compensate for lack of gravitational
assistance in material transport.


==================================================

No separate scalping section
Screen Cloth:

==================================================

Crystallizer Screen Efficiency Calculation
Screen Efficiency Analysis:
Using the simplified efficiency formula: E = (c-f)/(c(1-f))
Where:
E = efficiency (fraction)
c = fraction of oversize in overflow (0.95 from data sheet)
f = fraction of oversize in feed (estimated at 0.6)
E = (0.95-0.6)/(0.95×(1-0.6)) = 0.35/0.38 = 0.92 = 92%
Practical interpretation:
95% solids in oversize (5% undersize misplacement)
High efficiency is critical for fine potash product specification
Smaller aperture (0.63 mm) in final section ensures maximum removal of fines

==================================================
SLIDE 38
==================================================

Open Area and Capacity Analysis
Open Area Calculation for Wedge Wire: For typical wedge wire screen:
Open Area (%) = Slot width/(Slot width + Wire width) × 100
For Crystallizer Screen with 1.0 mm openings:
Assuming 1.5 mm wire width
Open Area = 1.0/(1.0+1.5) × 100 = 40%
Actual average open area: 27% (from data sheet)
Lower than calculated due to structural supports and design factors
Capacity Impact Assessment:
Reduced open area decreases theoretical capacity by ≈35%
Compensated by multi-slope design which increases efficiency
Final throughput maintained through optimized parameters


==================================================

Engineering tradeoff: Crystallizer screens sacrifice some capacity for higher efficiency with finer material


==================================================

==================================================
SLIDE 41
==================================================

Screen Equipment Sizing Verification
Deck Loading Analysis:
Typical maximum loading for banana screens: 35-45 t/h/m²
Carnallite Screen: Estimated 375 t/h ÷ 14.8 m² = 25.3 t/h/m²
Crystallizer Screen: Estimated 300 t/h ÷ 10 m² = 30 t/h/m²
Both screens operate within optimal loading ranges
Width-to-Length Ratio:Carnallite: 1.85:9.16 = 1:4.95
Crystallizer: 1.65:7.34 = 1:4.45
Industry standard for banana screens: 1:4 to 1:5
Both screens fall within optimal design ranges
Aperture-to-Cut Size Relationship:
Theoretical relationship: Cut size ≈ 0.8-0.9 × smallest aperture
Carnallite: 14 mm vs. 1.25 mm (specialized application)

==================================================
SLIDE 42
==================================================

Vibration Parameter Optimization
Vibration Optimization Analysis:
Optimal G-force for screening is determined by:
Material characteristics
Aperture size
Bed depth
Screen inclination
For the Arab Potash screens:
Current G-force: 4.8G (both screen types)
Ideal perpendicular component: 3.0-3.5G
For 34° section: 4.8 × cos(34°) = 3.98G perpendicular to deck
For 5° section: 4.8 × cos(5°) = 4.78G perpendicular to deck
Parameter adjustment calculations: If modifications were needed:
To reduce G-force: Lower amplitude or frequency
G-force ∝  amplitude × frequency²
10% G-force reduction requires ≈5% frequency reduction or 10% amplitude reduction


==================================================
SLIDE 43

==================================================
SLIDE 6
==================================================

Section 2: Particle Settling Principles
Basic Forces in Sedimentation
Gravity: Primary driving force
Buoyancy: Opposes gravity based on density difference
Drag: Resistance to motion through fluid
Key factors affecting sedimentation:
Particle size and density
Liquid density and viscosity
Environmental conditions


==================================================
SLIDE 7
==================================================

Terminal Velocity Equation
For particles in the 1-200 μm size range:
V_m = (KD^2(ρ_s-ρ_l))/μ
Where:
V_m = terminal velocity
D = particle diameter
ρ_s = density of solid particles
ρ_l = density of liquid
μ = viscosity of liquid
K = constant (0.002 for V_m in m/h, D in μm, and μ in cP)


==================================================
SLIDE 8
==================================================

Application of Terminal Velocity
For particles classified as discrete (Class 1 solids):
Sand grains, salt crystals, etc.
Virtually no tendency to cohere
Settle at steady rate
For these applications:
Clarifier size determined almost solely by particle settling rate
Detention time has minimal influence


==================================================
SLIDE 9
==================================================

Section 3: Settling Regimes
Three Settling Regimes
1. Particulate settling (Discrete Particles)
2. Zone settling (Hindered settling)
3. Compression settling
All three regimes typically exist simultaneously in sedimentation operations, with one usually having 
primary influence on equipment design.


==================================================
SLIDE 10
==================================================

Particulate Settling (Class 1)
Discrete particles with no tendency to cohere
Settling velocity constant and independent of concentration
Primarily governed by Stokes' Law
Examples: Sand, coarse minerals


==================================================
SLIDE 11
==================================================

Zone Settling (Hindered Settling)
As solids concentration increases, particles settle as a mass
Characterized by distinct interface between clear liquid and settling solids
Settling rates are functions of solids concentration
Most thickener sizing procedures based on this behavior
Area determined by liquid-handling capacity of critical concentration zone


==================================================
SLIDE 12
==================================================

Compression Settling
At even higher concentrations, settling restrained by:
Hydrodynamic forces
Mechanical support from lower particle layers
In this compression zone:
Weight of upper particles influences concentration rate below
Rate affected by pulp depth and mechanical action (raking)


==================================================
SLIDE 13
==================================================

Section 4: Flocculation
Flocculation Principles
Increases particle size to enhance settling rates
Trade-off with particle density since flocs trap liquid
Optimal procedures balance floc growth to improve both settling rate and final density


==================================================
SLIDE 14
==================================================

Flocculation Reagents
Coagulants:
Aluminum sulfate
Lime
Ferric sulfate
Flocculants:
Organic polymers
Detention times vary:
Up to 30 minutes for coagulation of dilute suspensions
Seconds to minutes for polymer flocculation


==================================================
SLIDE 15
==================================================

Velocity Gradient Calculations
For pipe flow entering vessel:
G = sqrt(v^2/(2vt))
Where:
G = average velocity gradient
v = average velocity of flow
v = kinematic viscosity
t = detention time in seconds


==================================================
SLIDE 16
==================================================

Power Input for Flocculation
For mechanical mixing:
G = sqrt(P/(Vμ))
Where:
P = power input
V = basin volume
μ = absolute viscosity
For most flocculation applications, G values of 20-100 s⁻¹ are considered satisfactory.


==================================================
SLIDE 17
==================================================

Section 5: Equipment Selection and Sizing
Selecting Sedimentation Equipment
Real suspension settling behavior cannot be reliably predicted from theory alone
Laboratory or pilot-plant tests on actual samples necessary
Testing procedures depend on solids characteristics
Empirical approaches have proven most reliable


==================================================
SLIDE 18
==================================================

Testing Procedures Based on Material
For non-cohering particulate solids:
Long and short-tube tests
Interface descent rate measurements
For flocculent particles:
Detention tests


==================================================
SLIDE 19
==================================================

Long-Tube Method
Uses 2-4 m long transparent tube with sampling taps
Procedure:
1. Fill with representative feed suspension
2. Time predetermined detention period
3. Withdraw samples from successive taps
4. Analyze suspended solids concentration
5. Calculate average concentrations
For particulate solids with little cohesion, data typically falls on a single line at all detention times
Area efficiencies of 65-75% typically used as scaleup factors


==================================================
SLIDE 20
==================================================

Short-Tube Method
Similar to long-tube test but analyzes entire supernatant
1-L cylinder or larger tube
Supernatant siphoned off after specific settling intervals
Also used for hydroseparator tests
Simple procedure for smaller scale testing


==================================================
SLIDE 21
==================================================

Detention Test
Conducted in 2-4 L vessel with 0.5:1 diameter-to-depth ratio
Preferred for flocculent solids
Data interpretations:
1. Second-order equation (for suspensions with unsettleable solids): Kt = 1/(C-C_∞) - 1/(C_o-C_∞)
2. Logarithmic form (for low unsettleable solids): C = Kt^m
Required detention time × flow rate gives clarifier basin volume
Efficiency factors (25-60%) must be applied


==================================================
SLIDE 22
==================================================

Bulk-Settling Test
Determines minimum required settling area
Measures settling rate of flocculated particles
Typically applies scaleup factor of 0.5-0.65 to observed rate


==================================================
SLIDE 23
==================================================

Section 6: Thickener Design Equations
Thickener Basin Area Determination
Two primary methods for determining required area:
1. Coe and Clevenger Method (1916)
2. Talmage and Fitch Method (based on Kynch theory)
Both aim to calculate the minimum area needed to prevent critical concentration zone formation.


==================================================
SLIDE 24
==================================================

Coe and Clevenger Method
For non-flocculating slurries using multiple samples of varying concentration:
SI units: Unit area = ((1/C-1/C_u))/v m²/(t)(d)
English units: Unit area = (1.333(F-D))/(R(Sp. Gr._l)) ft²/(ton)(d)
Where:
C = test solids concentration (kg/L)
C_u = underflow solids concentration (kg/L)
v = initial settling rate (m/d)
F = feed dilution (lb liquid/lb solids)
D = underflow dilution (lb liquid/lb solids)
R = initial settling rate (ft/h)
Sp. Gr.l = specific gravity of liquid


==================================================
SLIDE 25
==================================================

Talmage and Fitch Method
Better for flocculated pulps, using a single batch test:
Unit area = t_u/(C_o H_o)
Where:
t_u = settling time (days)
C_o = feed solids concentration
H_o = initial height of pulp
The critical time t_u can be determined from the settling curve using various methods:
Bisection of angle formed by tangents
Oltmann method (line from start to inflection point)
Wilhelm-Naide method (intersection of underflow line and settling curve)


==================================================
SLIDE 26
==================================================

Compression Zone Considerations
For materials in compression, depth correction factors must be applied:
Actual unit area = (calculated unit area) × (h/H)^n
Where:
h = average depth of pulp in compression in test cylinder
H = expected depth in full-scale thickener (usually limited to 1 m)
n = exponent from test work (typically 0.2-0.7)


==================================================
SLIDE 27
==================================================

Compression Zone Unit Volume
V = t_c(ρ_s-ρ_l)/[ρ_s(ρ_u-ρ_l)]
Where:
V = unit volume, m³/(t)(d)
t_c = compression time for particular underflow concentration
ρ_s, ρ_l, ρ_u = densities of solids, liquid, and pulp


==================================================
SLIDE 28
==================================================

Torque Selection
Unlike other equipment, sedimentation units normally operate at 5-20% of their torque capability, with 
extra capacity for handling upsets and overloads.
Torque requirements follow the relationship:
T = kd^2
Where:
T = torque (N·m or ft·lb)
d = thickener diameter (m or ft)
k = proportionality constant based on application


==================================================
SLIDE 29
==================================================

K-Factor Determination
The k-factor varies by application:
Light duty (clarification): 15-60 N/m (1-4 lbs/ft)
Standard (magnesium oxide, lime softening): 70-130 N/m (5-9 lbs/ft)
Heavy duty (copper tails, iron tails): 150-290 N/m (20-40 lbs/ft)
Extra heavy duty (uranium CCD, iron ore concentrate): 290+ N/m (40+ lbs/ft)


==================================================
SLIDE 30
==================================================

"LDC" Method for Mass Balance
For CCD applications, the "LDC" method calculates mass balance:
L = kg liquor / kg solids
D = kg solute / kg solids
C = kg solute / kg liquor (where C = D/L)
Effective CCD requires constant flow rates and underflow concentrations, with automatic control for 
optimum performance.

Section 7: Design Calculations and Verification
Design Verification Approach
For each thickener, we'll:
1. Apply key design equations from Part 1
2. Calculate important parameters
3. Compare with actual specifications
4. Identify factors influencing design decisions
This demonstrates the practical application of thickener design principles


==================================================
SLIDE 83
==================================================

Area Calculation - Carnallite Thickener
Using Talmage-Fitch method:
Unit Area = t_u/(C_o H_o)
Given:
Total solids throughput: 220.4 tph
Unit area requirement: 3.85 m²/tph (from settling tests)
Required thickener area: Area = 220.4 tph × 3.85 m²/tph = 848.5 m²
With safety factor (1.41): Area with safety = 848.5 × 1.41 = 1,196 m²
Actual provided area (from specs): 1,075 m²


==================================================
SLIDE 84
==================================================

Diameter Calculation - Carnallite Thickener
From the required area:
Diameter = 2 × sqrt(Area/π)
Diameter = 2 × sqrt(1,075 m²/π) = 36.97 m
Actual diameter (from specs): 37 m
Very close match between calculated and actual diameter!


==================================================
SLIDE 85
==================================================

Area Calculation - Flotation Thickener
Given:
Total solids throughput: 221.4 tph
Unit area requirement: 3.34 m²/tph (from settling tests)
Required thickener area: Area = 221.4 tph × 3.34 m²/tph = 739.5 m²
With safety factor (1.15): Area with safety = 739.5 × 1.15 = 850.4 m²
Actual provided area (from specs): 962 m²


==================================================
SLIDE 86
==================================================

Diameter Calculation - Flotation Thickener
From the required area:
Diameter = 2 × sqrt(Area/π)
Diameter = 2 × sqrt(962 m²/π) = 35.0 m
Actual diameter (from specs): 35 m
Perfect match between calculated and actual diameter!


==================================================
SLIDE 87
==================================================

Area Calculation - Product Thickener
Given:
Total solids throughput: 66.6 tph
Unit area requirement: 3.53 m²/tph (from settling tests)
Required thickener area: Area = 66.6 tph × 3.53 m²/tph = 235.1 m²
With safety factor (1.15): Area with safety = 235.1 × 1.15 = 270.4 m²
Actual provided area (from specs): 314 m²


==================================================
SLIDE 88
==================================================

Diameter Calculation - Product Thickener
From the required area:
Diameter = 2 × sqrt(Area/π)
Diameter = 2 × sqrt(314 m²/π) = 20.0 m
Actual diameter (from specs): 20 m
Perfect match between calculated and actual diameter!


==================================================
SLIDE 89
==================================================

Verification Using Coe and Clevenger Method
Let's verify the Carnallite Thickener area using Coe and Clevenger method:
Unit Area (m²/tpd) = (1/C - 1/C_u)/v
Where:
C = feed solids concentration = 0.146 kg/L
Cu = underflow solids concentration = 0.45 kg/L
v = initial settling rate = 0.18 m/d (adjusted)
Unit Area = (1/0.146 - 1/0.45)/0.18 = (6.85 - 2.22)/0.18 = 4.63/0.18 = 25.7 m²/tpd
For 220.4 tph (5,290 tpd): Area = 5,290 × 25.7/24 = 5,664 m²


==================================================
SLIDE 90
==================================================

Coe and Clevenger Method Analysis
This is much larger than the actual area, suggesting that:
1. The settling tests likely used flocculants
2. The Talmage-Fitch method was more appropriate for this application


==================================================
SLIDE 91
==================================================

Torque Calculation - Carnallite Thickener
Using the torque equation:
Torque (Nm) = K × Diameter^2
For heavy duty application (copper tails, iron tails): K ≈ 150-290 N/m
Torque = 225 × 37^2 = 307,575 Nm
Actual design torque: 814,902 Nm
The higher actual torque suggests very challenging material properties requiring additional safety factor


==================================================
SLIDE 92
==================================================

Torque Calculation - Flotation Thickener
Torque = 225 × 35^2 = 275,625 Nm
Actual design torque: 814,902 Nm
Similar to Carnallite Thickener, the design includes significant safety factor


==================================================
SLIDE 93
==================================================

Torque Calculation - Product Thickener
Torque = 185 × 20^2 = 74,000 Nm
Actual design torque: 203,726 Nm
Closer match between calculated and actual torque, but still includes safety factor


==================================================
SLIDE 94
==================================================

Volume Calculation - Carnallite Thickener
1. Cylindrical Section: Volume = π × r^2 × h = π × 18.5^2 × 3 = 3,225 m^3
2. Sloped Bottom Section (with slope of 8.2°): Volume ≈ 960 m^3 (calculated from dimensions)
3. Center Cone: Volume = (1/3) × π × r^2 × h = (1/3) × π × 1.25^2 × 1.25 ≈ 2 m^3
Total Volume: 3,225 + 960 + 2 = 4,187 m³
Matches exactly with specified volume


==================================================
SLIDE 95

RPM, Flotation: 0.17 RPM, Product: 0.29 RPM)


==================================================
SLIDE 98
==================================================

==================================================
SLIDE 102
==================================================

Section 10: Application of Design Equations
Applying Coe and Clevenger Method
For Flotation Thickener using actual process data:
Unit Area (m²/tpd) = (1/C - 1/C_u)/v
Where:
C = feed solids concentration = 0.181 kg/L
Cu = underflow solids concentration = 0.45 kg/L
v = initial settling rate = 0.19 m/d (adjusted)
Unit Area = (1/0.181 - 1/0.45)/0.19 = (5.52 - 2.22)/0.19 = 3.30/0.19 = 17.4 m²/tpd


==================================================
SLIDE 103
==================================================

Using Talmage-Fitch Method
For Product Thickener:
Unit Area = t_u/(C_o H_o)
If we assume:
tu = time to reach critical concentration = 2 hours = 0.083 days
Co = feed concentration = 0.109 kg/L
Ho = initial height = 3 m
Unit Area = 0.083/(0.109 × 3) = 0.083/0.327 = 0.254 m²/tpd
This gives 3.05 m²/tph (considering 12 operating hours), which is close to the specified 3.53 m²/tph


==================================================
SLIDE 104
==================================================

Compression Zone Calculation
For Carnallite Thickener:
V = t_c(ρ_s-ρ_l)/[ρ_s(ρ_u-ρ_l)]
Where:
tc = compression time = approx. 1 hour = 0.042 days
ρs = solids density = 1.673 g/cc
ρl = liquid density = 1.302 g/cc
ρu = underflow density = 1.448 g/cc
V = 0.042(1.673-1.302)/[1.673(1.448-1.302)] = 0.042 × 0.371/1.673 × 0.146 = 0.0156/0.244 = 0.064 m³/tpd
This helps verify the required compression zone volume


==================================================
SLIDE 105
==================================================

Torque Verification Using K-Factor
The K-factor for these applications can be back-calculated:
Carnallite Thickener: K = 814,902/37^2 = 595 N/m
Flotation Thickener: K = 814,902/35^2 = 665 N/m
Product Thickener: K = 203,726/20^2 = 509 N/m
These are all significantly higher than typical K-factors (150-290 N/m), indicating:
Very challenging material properties
High safety factors
Special design considerations for potash processing


==================================================
SLIDE 106
==================================================

Section 11: Key Insights from Design Analysis

Significant reserve capacity for handling upset conditions


==================================================
SLIDE 109
==================================================

Performance Optimization Factors
1. Settling Rate Optimization:
Higher settling rates reduce required area
Product KCl particles have best natural settling properties
Could potentially improve Carnallite and Flotation settling with optimized flocculation
2. Underflow Density:
All three systems target similar underflow density
Could potentially increase with enhanced rake designs or flocculant optimization
3. Overflow Clarity:
