==================================================
SLIDE 30
==================================================

Scroll Geometry and Transport Mechanics
Importance of Conveying Speed
Directly dictates residence time of solids within centrifuge
Critically affects:
Dewatering efficiency: Longer residence times allow more complete liquid drainage

==================================================
SLIDE 31
==================================================

Scroll Geometry Effects (cont.)

==================================================
SLIDE 32
==================================================

Role of Scroll Geometry
Physical configuration fundamentally determines solids transport rate

Critical for optimizing performance and product quality


==================================================
SLIDE 33
==================================================

Key Geometric Parameters

Varies axially in conical centrifuges
Defines conveying channel boundary


==================================================
SLIDE 34
==================================================

Key Geometric Parameters (cont.)
2. Scroll Pitch (P)
Axial distance per 360° turn of the helix
Directly influences conveying speed
Standard pitch (P=D), Short (P=2/3D, P=1/2D), Long (P=1.5D)


==================================================

==================================================
SLIDE 38
==================================================

Scroll Geometry (continued)
The transport process is aided by the inclination of the conical basket wall
Solids often accumulate in piles of triangular cross-section ahead of scroll flights
Scroll performs dual regulatory function:
In wet zones: Holds back material that would slide too quickly
In dry zones: Actively pushes material toward discharge
Adapts to changing frictional properties as material dewaters


==================================================
SLIDE 39
==================================================

Axial Velocity and Efficiency Calculations
Axial Conveying Velocity
Theoretical volumetric throughput: Q_th = (π/4)(D_s^2-d_c^2)P×Δ N×η_vol
Axial velocity: v_ax = Q_th/A_eff = [(π/4)(D_s^2-d_c^2)P×Δ N×η_vol]/[(π/4)(D_s^2-d_c^2)η_fill]
Simplified as: v_ax = P × ΔN × η_slip


==================================================
SLIDE 40
==================================================

Vortex Efficiency (Theoretical Conveying Efficiency)
Based on helix angle and friction: η_vortex = [tan(α_m+ρ')]/[tan(α_m)]
α_m = helix angle at effective radius
ρ' = effective friction angle
Shorter pitches reduce theoretical capacity but increase efficiency against resistance


==================================================
SLIDE 41
==================================================

Differential Speed and Conveying Rate

For fixed eccentric shaft: Δn = n_TR/i
For dual drive systems: Δn = n_TR - (n_EXZ × i)
n_TR = drum speed
n_EXZ = eccentric shaft speed
i = gear ratio (typically 1:15 to 1:40)


==================================================
SLIDE 42
==================================================

Scroll Speed Calculation
Scroll rotational speed: n_Schn = n_TR + (n_EXZ - n_TR)/i
Leading operation: Positive differential (scroll faster than drum)
Trailing operation: Negative differential (scroll slower than drum)


==================================================
SLIDE 43
==================================================

ρ_L = liquid density (kg/m³)


==================================================
SLIDE 44
==================================================

During film drainage: S = [k'/d][(r_2-r_c)/t]^A + S_∞
r_2-r_c = cake thickness (m)
A = coefficient (0.5-1.0 for incompressible materials)
t = drainage time (s)


==================================================
SLIDE 45
==================================================

Drainage rate constant: φ = [d cos^2 θ]/[2ω^2ρr_o]


==================================================
SLIDE 46
==================================================

Dimensionless Time Analysis
t_D = [μ_L/ρ_L][h G t/h^2]
μ_L = liquid viscosity
ρ_L = liquid density
h = cake height
G = centrifugal acceleration
t = time


==================================================
SLIDE 47
==================================================

Cone Angle Effects on Transport
Component of Centrifugal Force Along Screen
Parallel force component: F_{c,parallel} = F_c sin(θ_c) = mω^2r×sin(θ_c)
This assists in axial transport toward larger diameter end


==================================================
SLIDE 48
==================================================

Transport Force Balance
For particles on inclined screen:
Driving forces: Scroll push + Component of centrifugal force
Resisting forces: Friction against screen × Normal force

==================================================
SLIDE 49
==================================================

Calculating Transport in Practice
Empirical Approach
1. Start with theoretical relationship: v_ax = P × ΔN
2. Adjust for non-standard geometry using capacity factors (CF)
Short pitch (P=2/3D): CF = 1.50
Half pitch (P=1/2D): CF = 2.00
3. Apply efficiency factor based on material properties
Estimated range: 0.3-0.8 depending on material
4. Calculate residence time: t = (60 × w)/Δn
5. Adjust differential speed to achieve desired residence time


==================================================
SLIDE 50
==================================================

Residence Time Control
Residence Time Calculation
t = (60 × w)/Δn
t = residence time (seconds)
w = number of scroll turns/flights
Δn = differential speed (rpm)


==================================================
SLIDE 51
==================================================

Process Implications
Residence time remains constant regardless of feed quantity
Longer residence time improves dewatering but reduces throughput
Shorter residence time increases capacity but may reduce separation efficiency


==================================================
SLIDE 52
==================================================

Scroll Efficiency Factors
Factors Affecting Conveying Efficiency
Friction between material and screen/scroll surfaces

==================================================
SLIDE 53
==================================================

Modified Capacity Factors
Standard pitch scroll: CF = 1.00
Short pitch (P=2/3D): CF = 1.50
Half pitch (P=1/2D): CF = 2.00
Flight modifications (cut, folded): CF = 1.50-3.75

Scale-Up Methodologies for Centrifuges
Comparative Scale-Up Approaches
1. Sigma Theory (Equivalent Settling Area)
Primary method for sedimentation centrifuges
Based on: Σ = (ω^2/2g) × ∫r×dA

==================================================
SLIDE 55
==================================================

Sigma Theory Applications
Works well for dilute suspensions with minimal particle interaction
Limitation: Does not account for residence time effects
For tubular bowl: Σ = 2πω^2L/3g
For disk stack: Σ = 2πω^2n_d/3g·tan α
For decanter: Σ = [2πω^2L/g][2r_1r_2/3]


==================================================
SLIDE 56
==================================================

Capacity Factor Approach (C-Value Method)
Comprehensive approach that extends beyond Sigma theory
Incorporates residence time and g-force: f = z × Δt × m
Universal dimensionless number for comparing machines
Applicable across different centrifuge types
Better accounts for solids behavior in concentrated suspensions


==================================================
SLIDE 57
==================================================

Capacity Factor Approach (cont.)
Particularly valuable for screen-scroll and dewatering applications
Scale-up formula: m_2 = m_1 × [z_1 × Δt_1]/[z_2 × Δt_2]


==================================================
SLIDE 58
==================================================

Combined Methodologies for Robust Scale-Up
Use Sigma theory for initial sizing of sedimentation centrifuges
Apply Capacity Factor for final validation and residence time effects
Both approaches complement each other for comprehensive analysis
Critical to maintain dimensionless ratios across scales
For optimum design: Capacity Factor analysis + Drainage model with S_∞ calculations


==================================================
SLIDE 59
==================================================

Engineering Design Analysis and Calculations
Centrifugal Force and Separation Principles
The centrifugal force is the fundamental principle behind the operation of the CONTURBEX H1000
centrifuges at Arab Potash Company. The key equations governing this process are:


==================================================
SLIDE 94
==================================================

Angular Velocity Calculation
1. Angular Velocity Calculation: omega = 2π × N/60
For the APC centrifuges at 797 rpm: omega = 2π × 797/60 = 83.46 rad/s


==================================================
SLIDE 95
==================================================

Relative Centrifugal Force
2. Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF): RCF = r×omega^2/g = r×(2π×N/60)^2/g
With the simplified formula: RCF = 1.118 × 10^-5 × r × N^2
For the H1000 centrifuge with drum radius r = 0.509 m at operating speed: RCF = 1.118 × 10^-5 × 509 ×
797^2 = 353g


==================================================
SLIDE 96
==================================================

Centrifugation Number
3. Centrifugation Number (z): z = (π^2 × D × n^2)/(900 × g)
For the APC installation with D = 1.018 m and n = 797 rpm: z = (π^2 × 1.018 × 797^2)/(900 × 9.81) =
353
This aligns with the RCF calculation and confirms the designed centrifugal acceleration.


==================================================
SLIDE 97
==================================================

Residence Time and Differential Speed Analysis
The residence time is crucial for achieving optimal moisture content in the final product:
1. Residence Time Equation: t = (60 × w)/Δn
Where w is the number of scroll turns and Δn is the differential speed.


==================================================
SLIDE 98
==================================================

Differential Speed Calculation
2. Differential Speed Calculation:
For fixed gearbox: Δn = n_TR/i
For dual drive: Δn = n_TR - (n_EXZ × i)
For the retarded scroll configuration: Δn = -12.1 rpm (gear ratio i = 59)
t = (60 × w)/12.1 = 4.97 seconds
For the advanced scroll configuration: Δn = +13.5 rpm
t = (60 × w)/13.5 = 4.44 seconds


==================================================
SLIDE 99
==================================================

Gap Dimensioning
3. Gap Dimensioning: The gap between scroll and drum is maintained at 1.5-2.0‰ of nominal drum
diameter.
For the H1000 with drum diameter of 1018 mm: Gap = (1.5 to 2.0) × 1.018 = 1.53 to 2.04 mm
This precise gap enables efficient transport while preventing damage.


==================================================
SLIDE 100
==================================================

Sedimentation and Drainage Analysis
The moisture content of the final product is influenced by the sedimentation and drainage processes:
1. Sedimentation Velocity: V_s = [d^2(ρ_p-ρ_m)ω^2r]/(18η)


==================================================
SLIDE 101
==================================================

Sedimentation Velocity Calculation
For potash crystals with d = 0.5 mm, particle density ρp = 1.98 g/cm³, in brine with density ρm = 1.302
g/cm³ and viscosity η = 5 cP:
V_s = [0.5^2 × 10^-6 × (1980-1302) × 83.46^2 × 0.509]/[18 × 5 × 10^-3]
V_s = 17.3 cm/s
This high sedimentation velocity ensures efficient solid-liquid separation.


==================================================
SLIDE 102
==================================================

Drainage Assessment
2. Drainage Assessment: The final moisture content follows the relationship: S =
dk'[ρ_L(ω^2r/g)μ]t^B(r^2-r_c^2)^A + S_∞
Where S_∞ = kd^(-0.5)(ω^2r/g)^(-0.5)ρ_L^(-0.25)
For the APC installation, this translates to the target 7% maximum brine content (4.7% free water).


==================================================
SLIDE 103
==================================================

Dimensionless Time Analysis
3. Dimensionless Time Analysis: t_D = (μ_L/ρ_L)(hGt/h^2)
This parameter helps optimize the balance between throughput and moisture content.


==================================================
SLIDE 104
==================================================

Design Implementation at Arab Potash Company
The engineering calculations directly informed the centrifuge design and configuration at APC:
1. Selection of Dual Configuration Types:
Retarded scroll for final product stages where moisture content is critical
Advanced scroll for carnallite processing where throughput is prioritized


==================================================
SLIDE 105
==================================================

Design Implementation (cont.)
2. Optimization of Differential Speed:
Carnallite centrifuges: Configured for W > 1 operation
Product centrifuges: Configured for W ≈ 1 operation at transition zone
3. Screen Selection Based on Particle Size Distribution:
0.20 mm apertures with 8.3% open area
Optimized for particle size distributions with d50 ranging from 0.16-0.8 mm across applications


==================================================
SLIDE 106
==================================================

Capacity Factor Implementation
4. Capacity Factor Implementation: The benchmark capacity factor of 75,728 translated to operational
capacities of:
51.8 t/h for retarded scroll configuration
48.3 t/h for advanced scroll configuration
With safety factors applied, actual operating capacities range from 28.3-38.3 t/h.


==================================================
SLIDE 107

Design Implementation Summary
These calculations demonstrate how theoretical equations are applied to practical design decisions in the
CONTURBEX H1000 centrifuges at Arab Potash Company, optimizing performance across multiple
process streams with varying characteristics.


==================================================
SLIDE 108
==================================================

Capacity Factor Analysis for Installation Sizing
Building on the fundamental equations, the capacity factor approach provides a standardized method for
comparing and scaling centrifuge performance across different applications and operating conditions:
1. Capacity Factor Formulation: f = z · Δt · m
Where:
z = centrifugal acceleration (g-force)
Δt = residence time (seconds)
m = throughput capacity (tonnes/hour)


==================================================
SLIDE 109
==================================================

Benchmark Determination
2. Benchmark Determination: The reference benchmark for this application showed that 100% capacity
was reached with:
z = 282 g
Δt = 4.63 s
m = 58 t/h KCl
This yields a capacity factor of: f = 282 × 4.63 × 58 = 75,728


==================================================
SLIDE 110
==================================================

Arab Potash Installation Sizing
3. Arab Potash Installation Sizing: Using the established capacity factor, the 100% capacity is calculated
based on the actual operating parameters:
For retarded scroll configuration (Δt = 4.97 s): m = f/(z × Δt) = 75,728/(353 × 4.97) = 43.2 t/h KCl
For advanced scroll configuration (Δt = 4.44 s): m = f/(z × Δt) = 75,728/(353 × 4.44) = 48.3 t/h KCl


==================================================
SLIDE 111
==================================================

Safety Factor Application
Applying a safety factor of 25-30% for operational flexibility:
Carnallite centrifuges: 28.3/46.4 tph (actual/maximum)
1st Stage Product centrifuges: 38.3/46.4 tph
2nd Stage Product centrifuges: 37.4/46.4 tph


==================================================
SLIDE 112
==================================================

Installation Optimization Trade-offs
4. Installation Optimization Trade-offs:
Advanced scroll: Higher throughput (48.3 t/h theoretical) with potentially higher residual
moisture
Retarded scroll: Lower throughput (43.2 t/h theoretical) with improved dewatering efficiency
Different configurations selected based on process stream requirements


==================================================
SLIDE 113

Capacity Factor Methodology Benefits
This capacity factor methodology allows for consistent sizing across the three different applications at
Arab Potash Company while accounting for the unique separation characteristics of each process stream.

Feed particle size change
Diagnostic Steps:
Sample and analyze filtrate

==================================================
SLIDE 120
==================================================

Excessive Solids in Filtrate (cont.)
Corrective Actions:
Repair or replace screen
Adjust operational parameters
Consider pre-classification if persistent


==================================================
SLIDE 121
==================================================

Process Optimization Strategies
Feed Rate Optimization
Maximum sustainable feed rate determined by:
Motor current remaining below 90% of FLA
Vibration levels below 8 mm/s
Acceptable product moisture content


==================================================
SLIDE 122
==================================================

Differential Speed Optimization
Increased differential for difficult-to-separate materials
Decreased differential for materials sensitive to breakage
Optimum determined through systematic testing
Typical range: 2-5% of basket speed


==================================================
SLIDE 123
==================================================

Retention Time Calculation
This means the material moves axially at approximately 91.35 mm/s through the centrifuge, which with a
basket length of 645 mm gives a theoretical retention time of about 7.1 seconds. When compared with
the actual measured retention time of 4.44 seconds, this yields an efficiency factor of 0.63, reflecting
material sliding and other real-world factors.


==================================================
SLIDE 124
==================================================

Moisture Content Prediction and Verification
The final moisture content can be predicted using equilibrium saturation equations:
S_∞ = k'd^(-0.4)(ω^2r/g)^(-0.3)ρ_L^(-0.25)
For KCl with mean particle size d = 0.3 mm, operating at 797 rpm (353g): S_∞ = 0.48 × 0.3^(-0.4) ×
353^(-0.3) × 1.258^(-0.25) = 0.068


==================================================
SLIDE 125
==================================================

Moisture Content Results
This predicts a final liquid volume fraction of 6.8%, which closely matches the achieved moisture content
of 7% in the actual operation.
The time-dependent drainage follows: S = [k'/d][(r_2-r_c)/t]^A + S_∞
For a cake thickness of 15 mm and drainage time of 4.97 seconds (for retarded scroll configuration): S =
[0.48/0.3][(15/4.97)]^0.5 + 0.068 = 0.071
This confirms that the designed residence time is adequate to achieve the required final moisture content
of 7%.


==================================================
SLIDE 126
==================================================

Scale-Up Methodology Demonstration
To demonstrate the practical application of scale-up methodologies, consider scaling up from a pilot
centrifuge (D = 0.5 m, n = 1200 rpm, capacity = 15 t/h) to the industrial CONTURBEX H1000.
Using the Capacity Factor Approach: f = z_1 × Δt_1 × m_1 = z_2 × Δt_2 × m_2


==================================================
SLIDE 127
==================================================

Long-term Performance Optimization
Over five years of operation, the Arab Potash Company has implemented continuous improvement
initiatives based on operational data:
1. Differential Speed Optimization: Initial setting of +15 rpm for carnallite centrifuges resulted in
excessive torque. Through iterative testing and applying the capacity factor equation:
f = z × Δt × m
The optimum was found at +13.5 rpm, balancing throughput and mechanical stress.


==================================================
SLIDE 128
==================================================

Residence Time Adjustment
3. Residence Time Adjustment: For 2nd stage product centrifuges, moisture content was initially 8.3%.
By applying drainage theory:
S = S_∞ + (S_0 - S_∞)e^(-φt)
Residence time was increased from 4.2 to 4.97 seconds by changing differential speed from -10.2 to -12.1
rpm, achieving target moisture of 7%.


==================================================
SLIDE 129
==================================================

Dynamic Differential Speed Control
1. Dynamic Differential Speed Control: Implementation of variable frequency drives to adjust differential
speed in real-time based on:
Δn_optimal = Δn_base × (1 + k_1(S_target - S_measured) + k_2(T_feed - T_base))
Where k₁ and k₂ are empirically determined coefficients.
